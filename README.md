## Project Title
Samsung Mobile Phones Sales, Market Performance & 5G Coverage Analysis

## Description
This Power BI dashboard analyzes Samsung smartphone sales performance, 5G coverage trends, market share, and product-level performance across five major global regions from 2019 to 2024.

## Problem Statement
Samsungâ€™s mobile division needed a data-driven way to:
- Compare 5G coverage vs. 5G product preference by region
- Track sales and revenue by product model and region
- Evaluate total market share across quarters and geographies
- Determine which 5G-capable models drive the most revenue
This dashboard solves these challenges with real-time interactivity and comprehensive visual storytelling.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Visuals: Combo Charts, Donut Charts, Bar Charts, Trend Lines

## Process Summary
#### Data Preparation:
- Consolidated product sales, revenue, 5G status, and regional data
- Cleaned and normalized time-series values across years and quarters
- Created KPIs: total revenue, avg. coverage, avg. preference
#### Dashboard Development:
- Revenue trend and unit sold breakdown
- 5G market share by region and quarter
- Regional preference vs. coverage for 5G
- Product model rankings and best-sellers
- Cross-filtering by quarter, region, and capability

## Key Insights
- Galaxy Z Fold2 5G is the top-selling product (912K units)
- Latin America leads in revenue at $2.44B, followed closely by North America
- Average Regional 5G Coverage: 66.89%
- 5G-Capable Products contributed $7.93B out of $10.77B
- Revenue is stable across years but slightly dipped in 2022 and rebounded in 2024
- Market share across quarters is fairly consistent (~3.68 to 3.82)
- Asia-Pacific and North America show high preference but slightly lower coverage

## Recommendations
- Prioritize 5G expansion in Middle East & Africa, where preference exceeds current coverage
- Boost supply of best-sellers (Galaxy Z Fold2 and Galaxy A73 5G) in top regions
- Track performance quarterly, as Q1 and Q2 deliver marginally stronger market share
- Re-engage underperforming regions like Europe and MENA with regional campaigns
- Forecast future revenue based on past dips (e.g., 2022) to mitigate risk

## Challenges & Fixes
- Inconsistent 5G tags for some models: Used standardized binary mapping
- Missing market share per quarter: Built DAX measures to calculate averages
- Visual overcrowding: Organized layout into grouped panels with slicers
